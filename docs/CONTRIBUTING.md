# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Commit message rules/conventions

Commit messages should follow [rules](docs/commit-messages.md) for easier release process.

The reasons for these conventions:

* automatic generating of the changelog
* simple navigation through git history (e.g. ignoring style changes)

## Issues

are collected here on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/literat/srazvs/issues).

## Flow

We are using [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## Branching
For each feature/task/defect create a specific branch

For example:
- `[task-type]-[refs]-[name/description]`
- `defect-44-forgetting-visitors-program`
- `feature-31-print-program-details`
